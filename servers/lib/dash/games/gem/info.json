All hands on deck! Two players are put in charge of their very own submarine - and it’s seen quite a few adventures! Players need to keep it from sinking into the depths of the dark, mysterious ocean. One player needs to study their control manual and give instructions quickly, while the other player is in charge of the controls! Disarm all of the emergency alarms before the countdown timer expires to save your ship and keep exploring!",
