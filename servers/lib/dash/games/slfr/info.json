In this puzzling world, players must slice the right amount of ice and lava to clear the mammoth's path. <br /><br />The game is the fruit of multiple years of research and development by Ululab with the help of math learning experts from the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM). It has a smooth progression designed for kids who are new to fractions or who have not yet understood its basic concepts. The environment is free of written instructions, which lets students dive into math reasoning without being obstructed by their literacy level."

In this puzzling world, players must slice the right amount of ice and lava to clear the mammoth’s path. The game is the fruit of multiple years of research and development by Ululab with the help of math learning experts from the University of Quebec in Montreal (UQAM). It has a smooth progression designed for kids who are new to fractions or who have not yet understood its basic concepts. The environment is free of written instructions, which lets students dive into math reasoning without being obstructed by their literacy level.",
