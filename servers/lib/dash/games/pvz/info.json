                "about": "Developed in collaboration with PopCap/Electronic Arts and researchers at Florida State University, Use Your Brainz EDU assesses the critical competency of problem solving. In this game, players must outwit some very hungry zombies who are desperately trying to make it across a garden to invade your home and eat your brain. To thwart that effort, players must strategically plant a garden filled with powerful plant obstacles, each with different properties designed to keep those zombies at bay. The game keeps the fun of the popular commercial title, and on the surface is not significantly different. However, what makes Use Your Brainz EDU different is that GlassLab has added a layer underneath the game to capture evidence of student problem solving skills, turning an awesome game into a powerful alternative assessment vehicle.",
