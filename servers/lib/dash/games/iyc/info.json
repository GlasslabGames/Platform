The most widely adopted definition was developed by Chicago-based Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), which divides SEL into five key ‘competencies’: \n\n •Self-awareness: ability to accurately recognize one’s emotions and thoughts and their influence on behavior \n •Self-management: ability to regulate one’s emotions, thoughts, and behaviors effectively in different situations \n •Social awareness: ability to take the perspective of and empathize with others from diverse backgrounds and cultures \n •Relationship skills: ability to establish healthy and rewarding relationships with diverse individuals and groups \n •Responsible decision-making: ability to make constructive and respectful choices about personal behavior and social interactions based on consideration of ethical standards, safety concerns, social norms, the realistic evaluation of consequences of various actions, and the well-being of self and others"
