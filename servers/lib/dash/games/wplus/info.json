The end goal of each puzzle is to fill each water bear’s bubble with the correct color water. Each puzzle has been designed to give students hands-on experience with different Systems Thinking concepts, such as identifying interconnections, using leverage points, and managing limited resources. Some puzzles introduce game mechanics or Systems Thinking concepts, while others provide engaging challenges that help students develop deeper problem-solving skills.<br /><br />After working with systems in the game, students have the tools to participate in meaningful classroom discussions about Systems Thinking concepts that can be difficult to grasp without concrete experience. This guide includes lesson plans that give an introduction to Systems Thinking in the context of Next Generation Science Standards, as well as provides a framework to customize lesson plans to suit the needs of different classrooms and students.",
